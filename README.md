***# StudyBuddy CLI – Simple Study Planner***



This is a basic Python project that helps manage subjects, tasks, and study sessions.  

Everything works in the terminal and all data is saved in a JSON file.

***## Features***

\- Add new subjects  

\- Add and view tasks  

\- Mark tasks as done  

\- Record study sessions  

\- Weekly study report  

\- Simple suggestion system

***## Purpose***

I made this project to practice basic Python, file handling and keep a simple offline study planner.

I wanted to do something simple but still useful.  

A study planner felt like a good idea because I can actually use it myself, and it doesn’t need any complicated libraries.  

Also, it helped me practice file handling, dictionaries, lists, and functions in Python.

***## Things that can be improved later***

\- Adding a real timer instead of a quick one  

\- Preventing duplicate subjects  

\- Saving timestamps for sessions  

\- Maybe adding simple colours in the terminal  

\- Sorting tasks by due date  

For now, it works fine for basic use.

***## Requirements***



Just Python 3.  

No extra modules are needed.



---



***## How data is stored***



Everything (subjects, tasks, sessions) is kept inside a single JSON file:

data/study\_data.json



It updates whenever I add, change, or finish something.

***## Conclusion***



This project helped me revise Python basics in a practical way.  

The code is simple, so even beginners can understand what’s happening.  

I made sure not to use anything too advanced and kept the functions clean and short.
