# StudyBuddy CLI – Statement Document

## 📌 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to manage multiple subjects, upcoming deadlines, incomplete tasks, and their daily study schedule. Most study-planning tools are either too complex, require online access, or contain unnecessary features that overwhelm beginners.
